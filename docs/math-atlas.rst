Version guide
--------------------------------

Current version: 0.0.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We have built and tested questions 0101 to 0401. Up until 0501 part 1, we were using plain javascript. From 0501 part 2 onwards, we will transition to using typescript. To guarantee backwards compatibility, some functions are repeated in the new typescript files. For such functions, we will append a "Y" behind the file name. Also from 0501 part 2 we implement the fraction object class to handle fractions in our code.
