Version guide
=================

Current version: 0.0.0: 
------------------------

Still in testing phase, nothing functional. 
We plan to move Math Bounty to version 0.1.0 when Math Atlas is ready for release and then to version 1.0.0 when Math Bounty is ready for release.

Developer Blog
==================

------------
Two products are planned: 

1. Math Atlas, a hybrid app featuring 10-14 questions, with an interface for students to key in answers and be graded.
2. Math Bounty, a web app that generates questions into worksheets. 

We have currently coding Math Atlas and plan to port the questions over to Math Bounty after release. We decided to move from a code first approach to a design first approach and will thus be writing documentation for the questions starting from question 5. As of today, that is the only working page in this documentation.
