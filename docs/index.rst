Two products are planned: 

1. Math Atlas, a hybrid app featuring 10-14 questions, with an interface for students to key in answers and be graded.
2. Math Bounty, a web app that generates questions into worksheets. 

We have currently coding Math Atlas and plan to port the questions over to Math Bounty after release. We decided to move from a code first approach to a design first approach and will thus be writing documentation for the questions starting from question 5. As of today, that is the only working page in this documentation.
