Question 1301
--------------------------------

The question
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This question is inspired by the 2007 H2 Mathematics (9740) Paper 1 Question 3b.

..  admonition::    Question example

    (4 marks) The complex number $z$ is such that $az + zz^* = b + ci$ ($az$ may be replaced with $aiz$ or $az^*$), where $z^*$ is the complex conjugate
    of $z$. Find $z$ in the form $x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real.

Randomly generated elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*   $a$ and $y$ are randomly generated ($18^2$ options)
*   Question variant: (3 options)

This gives the potential for 972 unique questions.

Pedagogy notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This question works on a student's ability to expand complex numbers and compare the real and imaginary parts.

Developer/mathematical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

$a$ is generated to be even so that all values in this question will be integers and the answer is non-zero.
