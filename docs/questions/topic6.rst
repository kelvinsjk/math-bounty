Question 0601
--------------------------------

The question
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This question is inspired by the 2008 H2 Mathematics (9740) Paper 1 Question 7.

..  admonition::    Question example

    (diagrams)

    A plot of land is being designed for a farm. The plot of land consists of a rectangle :math:`x` m by :math:`y` m together with a(n) semicircle/equailateral triangle of diameter/sides semicircle :math:`x` m, as shown in the diagram. Fences will be built along the perimeter of this plot of land. The cost of building the fence along the outside of the rectangle is $:math:`a` per metre while the cost of building the fence along the outside of the semicircle/triangle is $:math:`b` per metre. It is given that the total cost of building the fence is $:math:`c` and the total area of the plot of land is denoted by :math:`A`.

    (a) 
    
        (i) (2/1 marks) Show that :math:`y = f(x)`
        (ii) (2/3 marks) Hence show that :math:`A=g(x)`

    (b)
    
        (i) (4 marks) Use differentiation to find the values of :math:`x` and :math:`y` which gives a stationary value of :math:`A`.
        (ii) (2 marks) Determine, with a reason, whether the values of :math:`x` and :math:`y` in (bi) gives a minimum or maximum value of :math:`A`.

Randomly generated elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*   :math:`a,b` and :math:`c` (xxx options)
*   Either a semicircle or a triangle (2 options)

This gives the potential for up to yyy unique questions.

Pedagogy notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We work on numeracy by varying :math:`a,b` and :math:`c`.

We work on structure by modifying the type of figures used. For part (a), either trigonometry or pythagoras theorem has to be used for the triangle while the formulas (circumference and area) for a circle will be tested.  

Developer notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For the ease of constructing the solution, we will modify the :math:`b` value for each case to ensure the answers can be obtained by alternating between :math:`\pi` with :math:`\sqrt{3}`.
