Question 1201
--------------------------------

The question
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This question is inspired by the 2007 H2 Mathematics (9740) Paper 1 Question 8.

..  admonition::    Question example

    The line $l$ passes through $A$ and $B$ with coordinates $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and $(b_1, b_2,b_3)$ respectively. The plane
    $p$ has equation $n_1 x + n_2 y + n_3 z = k$.

    (a)
        
        (i) (2 marks) Find the equation of the line $l$ in the form $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{a} + \lambda \mathbf{d}, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.
        
        (ii) (3 marks) Find the coordinates of the point of intersection of $l$ and $p$.

    (b) 
    
        (i) (3 marks) the acute angle between $l$ and $p$.

        (ii) (3 marks) the perpendicular distance from $A$ (or $B$) to $p$.

    Remarks: in a second variant of the question, we will give the equation of $l$ and provide a point $C (0,0,\pm k)$ (possibly permutated) and two direction vectors:
    $-n_2 \mathbf{j} + n_1 \mathbf{j}$ and $-\frac{n_3}{n_1}\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{k}$. We will then ask in (ai) for the equation of the plane $p$ and in (bii) for the
    perpendicular distance between $C$ and $l$.


Randomly generated elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*   $a_i,b_i$s (approximately $18^6$ options)
*   $n_i$s such that one of the 3 componenets is $\pm 1$: (approximately $2 \times 18^2$ options)
*   $k$: (40 options)
*   Question variant: (2+ options)

This gives the potential for approximately 2 trillion unique questions.

Pedagogy notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Varying the elements allow us to work on numeracy. In question variant 1, we work on forming the equation of a line and finding the perpendicular distance from a point to a plane.
In question variant 2, we work on forming the equation of a plane and finding the perpendicular distance from a point to a line.

Developer/mathematical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Four elements of $a_i,b_i$ will be randomly generated while the other two chosen from the factors of $a_{i_1}b_{i_1} + a_{i_2} b_{i_2}$ such that the dot product of $OA$ and $OB$ will be zero.
