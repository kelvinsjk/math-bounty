Question 1101
--------------------------------

The question
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This question is inspired by the 2007 H2 Mathematics (9740) Paper 1 Question 6.

..  admonition::    Question example

    Referred to the origin $O$, the position vectors of the points $A$ and $B$ are 
    
    .. math::

        a_1 \mathbf{i} + a_2 \mathbf{j} + a_3 \mathbf{k} \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad b_1 \mathbf{i} + b_2 \mathbf{j} + b_3 \mathbf{k}

    respectively. 

    (a)
        
        (i) (2 marks) Given that $OA$ is perpendicular to $OB$, find the value of $a_i$ (or $b_i$).
        
        (ii) (3 marks) Find the position vector of the point $M$ on the line segment $AB$ such that $AM \colon MB = m \colon n$ (or $AM:AB$).

    (b) (4 marks) The point $C$ has position vector $c_1 \mathbf{i} + c_2 \mathbf{j} + c_3 \mathbf{k}$. Use a vector product to find the exact area of triangle $OAC$ (or $OBC$).


Randomly generated elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*   $a_i,b_i$s (approximately $18^4$ options)
*   $m,n$: (19 options)
*   $AM:MB$ vs $AM:AB$: (2 options)
*   $c_i$s (approximately $18^3$ options)
*   Triangle $OAC$ vs $OBC$ (2 options)

This gives the potential for approximately 46 billion unique questions.

Pedagogy notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Varying the elements allow us to work on numeracy while practicing the dot and cross products and ratio theorem.

Developer/mathematical notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Four elements of $a_i,b_i$ will be randomly generated while the other two chosen from the factors of $a_{i_1}b_{i_1} + a_{i_2} b_{i_2}$ such that the dot product of $OA$ and $OB$ will be zero.
